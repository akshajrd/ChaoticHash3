Cryptographic hash functions, the cornerstone of data security, are vulnerable to quantum computing attacks, compromising the integrity of industry-standard hash functions like SHA-256. To counter this threat, a novel chaotic hashing function, ChaoticHash3, was developed, leveraging the double pendulum's sensitivity to initial conditions to generate high-entropy, unpredictable hash outputs. By mapping ASCII-encoded input strings to physical parameters and simulating the double pendulum's chaotic motion, a 256-bit hash output was generated.

Statistical tests, including Hamming distance, Pearson chi-square, and Shannon entropy, demonstrated ChaoticHash3's superior diffusion, randomness, and bit unpredictability compared to traditional hash functions. Unlike conventional bitwise-based hashing, which relies on structured algebraic operations that quantum algorithms efficiently exploit, ChaoticHash3 introduces nonlinear chaotic transformations that disrupt computational shortcuts. While deterministic in simulation, chaotic evolution resists quantum parallelization, reducing the effectiveness of Groverâ€™s algorithm in identifying structured patterns.

This innovative approach has the potential to enhance post-quantum cryptographic security, providing a nonlinear alternative resistant to quantum attacks. Future work involves optimizing performance, integrating other chaotic systems, and testing against NIST randomness benchmarks for widespread adoption.
